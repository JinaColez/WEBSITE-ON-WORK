        <p>
        Hi I'm Renz Jimenez a small programmer in the Philippines. I'am prominent in backend development and also front end
        development, as a small programmer I want to use my skill. I'm willing to upskill my programming knowledge to pursue
        higher heights in search for great knowledge in the league of IT. I want to inspire other developers to enhance
        their own skill and be part of the group.

        <h2>HOBBIES↴</h2>
        <p>
            I enjoy programming just like everyone, I embrace it as one of my hobbies. I also like to study everything about Information Technology as I said I'm confident enough to be sufficient in divisions like hardware, programming, gaming, etc. But that's not a brag since IT is a fast and vast world to learn about.
